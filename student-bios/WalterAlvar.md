### I came from El Salvador:

A warm little country in the tropical Central America. :surfer:

I have been studying and working with Fine Arts since i was 15 years old (currently 35 y/o) and specially with Tattoo industries since 2013. I even win a prize in a Tattoo Show in El Salvador 2016.

Right now, I'm starting my Web Development career with the __Hack Your Future Belgium__ team. I have studied Graphic Design in _Universidad de Buenos Aires_ in Argentina, and I love Digital and traditional Illustration.

### Social:
I have been working with children from the poorest zones of El Salvador to teach them Art as a hobby, a profession, but mostly as a way to express themselves. I hope in the near future i could teach them I.T. maybe with a project as cool as __"Hack Your Future"__. :art:
